I am sachsen from my grandparents' side, they were deported to Russia 40 years ago. 
I am grateful that I am today able to take further the legacy of sachsens and be proud of my very origins. 
I am not sachsen but I prefer living my life next to my German friends because they always do great things and they celebrate a lot. 
My mom is German and my dad is Hungarian. They lived in Nurnberg but later in life moved to Romania and I was eventually born here and led my childhood in this very village. 
I am grateful that not far from my village I got to a German school and grew my social life and further career near where I studied. 
Living in a German community yet in Romania is simply exciting.
