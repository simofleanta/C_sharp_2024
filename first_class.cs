//C# is an object-oriented program. In object-oriented programming(OOP), we solve complex problems by dividing them into objects.
//To work with objects, we need to perform the following activities:

//create a class
//create objects from the class

// first class 

class program{

}

// a class can contain  * variables to store data * methods to perform the tasks 

class dog{

    //field
    string breed

    //method
    public void bark() {

    }
}
